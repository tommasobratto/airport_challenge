# Airport

### Makers Academy first week's challenge.

You have an airport, some planes, randomly changing weather.
The airport must allow the planes to take off or land only if the weather is sunny.
Landing or taking off changes a plane's flying status (flying or not flying).
If they are not allowed to land or take off because of stormy weather, their current status will not change.
The weather must change using a random number generator.
